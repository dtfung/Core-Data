Navigation Control with Core Data

An application that allows the user to transition between views using a Navigation Controller.  The data is stored in a Data Access Object and uses a singleton as the only instance to communicate with the rest of the view controllers. The UICollectionView class is used to display data retrieved from the database.  Core data was used to persist changes made by the user, such as when products are deleted.
